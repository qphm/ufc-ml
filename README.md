## Introduction
Founded in 1993, the UFC has built itself into a behemoth in the world of MMA and in 2016 was acquired by WME-IMG in an all-cash deal. At $4 billion, this is officially the largest sports organization sale in history. Much like other sports, the UFC has seen an explosion in data analytics over the past few years. But, can these fights be predicted? We used historical fight data to answer the question of whether UFC fights could be predicted.
